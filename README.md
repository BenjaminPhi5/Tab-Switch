Often you can quickly accumulate a large number of tabs, and being able to quickly switch between them, regardless of window or desktop, is particularly useful. Tab-Switch allows you to see all tabs currently open and quickly switching between them. It also allows muting and closing of tabs from within the popup.

# Future features to be included
* shortcuts to provide the same functionality without moving the mouse
* allow seach of currently open tabs
* prevent xss scripting issues on page titles
* actually release to chrome webstore
* quick link to be able to share a particular tab.
